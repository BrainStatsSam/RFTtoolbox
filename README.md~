# RFTtoolbox: A toolbox designed for generation and analysis of random fields both continuously sampled and on a lattice.
NOTE: This is a BETA version of this toolbox. Many more random field functions will soon be added.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The RFTtoolbox currently contains code to generate smooth Gaussian, t and 
F fields on a lattice of arbitrary size. 

It will soon contain code to perform clusterwise inference and analysis
and to generate convolution fields.
